# CarInsuranceClaimPrediction

This repository is dedicated to developing a Python project using machine learning algorithms to analyze the importance of preprocessing steps in Car Insurance Claim Prediction.

I explore and compare the performance of various machine learning models with and without preprocessing, showcasing how these steps affect the accuracy, precision, recall, and overall predictions.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Demonstrates the importance of feature scaling, oversampling (using SMOTE), and undersampling to address class imbalance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements multiple classifiers including:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
  - Logistic Regression
  - Voting Classifier (Ensemble Model)
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and classification reports.
  
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Imbalanced-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
